I'll help refine the requirements for this ticket by asking clarifying questions about the condition field overflow issue.               


                                                      Questions for Clarification:                                                       

 1 Current Behavior: From the video, what specifically looks "weird" when the condition field overflows? Is it that the scrollbar appears
   but doesn't look right, content gets cut off, or something else?                                                                      
 2 Expected Behavior: What should the condition field look like when it contains more content than can be displayed at once?             
 3 Affected Components: Is this issue only affecting the "Agent Can Respond" condition field shown in the video, or does it affect other 
    similar components throughout the application?                                                                                       
  4 Device/Browser Compatibility: Has this issue been observed across all browsers and devices, or is it specific to certain             
    environments?                                                                                                                        
  5 Scrolling Mechanism: Should the field have a vertical scrollbar, expand to show all content, or implement some other solution?       
  6 Design Guidelines: Are there existing design patterns or UI components in the application that handle overflow content that we should
    follow for consistency?                                                                                                              
  7 Priority Areas: Which aspects of the fix are most important - aesthetics, usability, or both?                                        
  8 User Impact: How is this issue affecting users' ability to use the product effectively?                                              
  9 Related Components: Are there other similar components in the application that might need the same fix applied?                      
 10 Accessibility Requirements: Are there any specific accessibility considerations we need to account for with the scrolling behavior?

 2 Ensure the fix works consistently across all browsers and devices                                                                     
 3 The solution should maintain the current visual design of the component while addressing the overflow issue
