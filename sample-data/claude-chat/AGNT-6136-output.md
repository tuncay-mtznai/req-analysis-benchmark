 I'll help you refine the requirements for this ticket by asking
  clarification questions to better understand the issue.

⏺ Let me look for files related to conditions and UI components where this
  issue might be occurring.

⏺ Let me look for any components related to conditions or triggers where
  this scrolling issue might occur.

⏺ Search(pattern: "condition.*component|trigger.*condition")…

⏺ Let me look specifically for logic node condition components since that
  seems relevant based on the visual context.

     import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite'
     import { useCallback, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

⏺ Now let's look at the AutoExpandingTextArea component since that appears
  to be used for the condition field:

⏺ Read(file_path: "src/components/design/autoExpandingTextArea.tsx")…
  ⎿  import type React from 'react'
     import {
         type ChangeEvent,
     ... (+94 lines)

⏺ Now let me check what the customScrollbarClasses are since they might be
  related to the issue:

⏺ Read(file_path: "src/components/design/scrollable.tsx")…
  ⎿  import {
         createContext,
         createRef,
     ... (+81 lines)

⏺ Let me check if there are any known issues with the custom scrollbar
  styles that might be causing the problem:

⏺ Task(Look through the codebase to find any issues or tickets related to …
      scrollbar problems or overflow issues in UI components, particularly
      with the condition field in the Logic Node Condition component or
      similar UI components. Examine both code and comments for any
      mentions of scrolling issues or visual bugs.)

⏺ Based on my research, I'll formulate some questions to help clarify the
  requirements.

  1. Which specific UI component is experiencing the issue with the
  condition field? Is it the Logic Node Condition component in the graph
  layout?
  2. What exactly does "looks weird" mean in the context of the issue? Is
  it:
    - Text getting cut off?
    - Scrollbar appearing in an unexpected location?
    - Content jumping when scrolling?
    - Scrollbar styling issues?
    - Something else?
  3. Is this a pure visual styling issue, or does it also affect
  functionality (like inability to read or input text correctly)?
  4. Does the issue occur only on certain screen sizes or devices, or is it
   reproducible on all environments?
  5. Are there any specific steps to reproduce the issue consistently?
  6. Is the issue specific to long condition text, or does it happen with
  any amount of content?
  7. Does this issue affect other similar components that use
  AutoExpandingTextArea, or is it unique to the condition field?
  8. From the video and description, is there an expected behavior for how
  the condition field should handle overflow?
  9. Are there any related design guidelines or mockups showing how the
  condition field should properly display?
  10. Is this a regression from a previous version that worked correctly?

    Based on the current information and what I can see from the code, I
  would draft these preliminary requirements:

  10-yes

⏺ Thanks for the answers. Based on your feedback, I'm updating the
  requirements to focus on the text cut-off issue that occurs on all
  devices.
