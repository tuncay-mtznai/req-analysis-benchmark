The condition field is implemented using the `LogicNodeConditionInput` component, which uses an `AutoExpandingTextArea` component with a fixed `maxHeight` of 550px.\n\n3. When the content exceeds this height, the textarea enables vertical scrolling, but there are visual issues with how the scrolling interacts with the fixed condition prefix.\n\n4. The condition prefix is positioned absolutely at the top-left of the textarea and doesn\'t scroll with the content, which creates a visual inconsistency.\n\n5. Ensure that when scrolling occurs:\n   - The condition prefix remains visible but doesn\'t interfere with the scrolling content\n   - The scrolling behavior is smooth and intuitive\n   - The text doesn\'t overlap with the condition prefix when scrolling\n\n6. Maintain all existing functionality of the condition field, including:\n   - Auto-expanding behavior up to the maximum height\n   - Preventing selection of the condition prefix\n   - Proper handling of keyboard events and focus management", "open_questions": ""}'
