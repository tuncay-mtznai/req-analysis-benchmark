npx zane plan:save appl-6736 "# Implementation Plan for APPL-6736\n\n## Overview\nFix the z-index issue where the \"this thread listens to 1 event\" box appears above the blue hover indicator in the testing sidebar.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n1. The issue appears to be a z-index conflict between the event listener box and the hover indicator in the testing sidebar.\n2. The event listener box is likely rendered through a floating portal (based on ActionOutputMenuPopoverV2 component).\n3. The hover indicator is part of the sidebar UI components.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Locate and Modify Event Listener Box Component**\n   - The event listener box is rendered through ActionOutputMenuPopoverV2 component\n   - Currently uses z-10 class for z-index\n   - Need to adjust z-index to be lower than the hover indicator\n\n2. **Ensure Proper Stacking Context**\n   - Review and adjust z-index values in the component hierarchy\n   - Ensure parent elements do not create conflicting stacking contexts\n\n3. **Testing**\n   - Verify hover indicator appears above the event listener box\n   - Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)\n   - Ensure no other UI elements are affected\n\n## Files to Modify\n- \"apps/web/src/layouts/Lindy/EditorLayout/sections/EditorSidebarPanel/GraphEntityEditorPanel/entities/components/ActionConfig/ActionConfig2/components/InputBox/components/ActionOutputMenuPopoverV2.tsx\"\n\n## Technical Solution\nAdjust the z-index of the event listener box to be lower than the hover indicator by:\n1. Modifying the z-index class in ActionOutputMenuPopoverV2\n2. If needed, create a new z-index class in the tailwind configuration\n\n## Risks and Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Changing z-index might affect other UI elements\n- **Mitigation**: Carefully test the change with different UI states and components\n\n## Testing Plan\n1. Verify the blue hover indicator appears above the event listener box\n2. Test in different browsers\n3. Check that other UI elements maintain proper z-index layering"
