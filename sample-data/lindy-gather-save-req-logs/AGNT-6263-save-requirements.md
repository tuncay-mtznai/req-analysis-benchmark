The tooltip appears when hovering over the sidebar toggle button in the header and sidebar.\n3. Currently, the tooltip appears slightly above the vertical center of the button due to a hardcoded offset of `-4` pixels in the `TooltipContent` component.\n4. Modify the `TooltipContent` component in the design system to properly center tooltips vertically with their trigger elements.\n5. Ensure the fix applies to all tooltips in the application that use the same component, maintaining consistent behavior.\n6. The tooltip should remain horizontally aligned with its current position.\n7. The tooltip should maintain its current appearance, content, and behavior other than the vertical positioning.\n8. The fix should work across all screen sizes and device types.\n\n### Technical Details\n- The issue is in the `TooltipContent` component in `packages/design/src/Tooltip/Tooltip.tsx`.\n- The component uses Floating UI for positioning, but has a hardcoded vertical offset of `-4` pixels.\n- This offset needs to be removed or adjusted to ensure proper vertical centering.", "open_questions": ""}'
